I am an undergraduate computer engineering student focused on software engineering and the processes that support building reliable and maintainable software. I enjoy working with DevOps tools, Linux, and containers to streamline development and deployment, as well as programming for distributed and IoT systems. Alongside the engineering side, I’m interested in how software and AI shape human behavior, gets used by the public, and affect society at large. I hope to pursue graduate work that lets me connect high-quality software engineering with thoughtful consideration of its human impact.
